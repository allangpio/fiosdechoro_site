This is my first project and I used HTML, SASS and JavaScript to develop it.

To see it live go to [www.fiosdechoro.com.br](http://www.fiosdechoro.com.br)

The goal of this project was to put into practice the concepts that I was learning (CSS Grid, responsive layout and some basic JS features, like animations on scroll and changing through sections of the website).
